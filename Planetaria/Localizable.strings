// MARK: - Objects



// MARK: Sun

"Solar System Subtitle" =
"Explore the Sun and the Planets";

"Solar System Description" =
"The Solar System is a massive conglomeration of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other objects gravitationally bound to the Sun.";

"Sun Subtitle" =
"The Star of the Solar System";

"Sun Description" =
"The Sun is a middle-sized yellow main-sequence star in the center of the Solar System. It is composed of plasma and incandescent gas at unimaginably hot temperatures. The Sun produces nuclear energy by fusing hydrogen into helium in its core, and it radiates light and heat to all of the planets and moons of the Solar System.";


// MARK: Planets


// Mercury

"Mercury Description" =
"Though it may be small, Mercury is the fastest planet in the Solar System, zooming around the Sun in only three months along its wobbly, eccentric orbit. Its surface is heavily cratered, and it has no atmosphere, causing temperatures to range from very hot on the side facing the Sun to very cold on the dark side.";


// Venus

"Venus Description" =
"Venus holds the title of the hottest and most hellish planet in the Solar System. Its extremely hot and dense atmosphere, filled with thick clouds of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, means humans wouldn't survive even with protective equipment. It also spins really slowly, in the opposite direction of most planets.";


// Earth

"Earth Description" =
"Our home planet, Earth, is the only known world to contain life. It's a terrestrial planet with an active and habitable surface, filled with deep oceans, lush forests, vast deserts, and high mountains. Earth's position in the Solar System allows for liquid water, which, along with its oxygen-rich atmosphere, allows life to thrive.";

"Earth-Moon System Description" =
"Our local system, the only place humanity has ever set foot, is composed of the Earth and the Moon. The Moon's position relative to the Sun causes a cycle of lunar phases to be visible from Earth throughout its monthly orbit. The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, meaning we always see the same side.";

"Moon Description" =
"The Moon is Earth's sole natural satellite and one of the largest moons in the Solar System. The Moon is notable for its distinctive lunar phases as viewed from Earth, as well as its tidal effects on Earth's oceans. It's the only object humanity has set foot on so far other than Earth itself.";


// Mars

"Mars Description" =
"Despite being our greatest prospect for interplanetary travel, Mars is a barren wasteland. It's thought to have once been hospitable for life and maybe even contained large amounts of liquid water, but it has gradually evolved into a desolate landscape of rusting iron, giving it a distinctive red color.";

"Martian System Description" =
"Mars hosts a pair of moons known as Phobos and Deimos. They're small objects which are barely even spherical and span only a few kilometers – they also orbit very closely to Mars. Compared to Earth's moon as well as those of the gas giants, the Martian moons are fairly unimpressive.";

"Phobos Description" =
"Phobos is the larger of the two Martian moons, and it orbits very closely to the planet's surface. It's eventually going to crash into Mars.";

"Deimos Description" =
"Deimos is the smaller of the two moons of Mars. It's not even large enough to have a spherical shape.";


// Jupiter

"Jupiter Description" =
"Behold! The ruler of the Solar System, Jupiter. This enormous planet – the biggest one in the Solar System – is a gas giant known for its swirling bands of colorful clouds.

"Jovian System Description" =
"Jupiter boasts a ludicrous quantity of natural satellites, and some of the largest in the Solar System. Among them are the Galilean Moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These four massive moons were the first moons besides Earth's to be discovered, and they're planets in their own right. Even more moons continue to be discovered today.";

"Io Description" =
"The initial sight of Io may surprise you; this uniquely-patterned moon really does look like a pizza. Io is the densest moon in the Solar System, and it's home to lots of geologic activity, giving its surface a strange mix of colors and varied topology – it has high mountains and lots of volcanoes.";

"Europa Description" =
"Europa is a Galilean moon of Jupiter with a thin atmosphere and a smooth surface marked with streaks, like nails on a chalkboard. It contains a deep ocean of liquid water beneath its surface which could potentially be hospitable for some form of extraterrestrial life. NASA's Europa Clipper mission is set to study Europa soon.";

"Ganymede Description" =
"Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, even larger than the planet Mercury. Its surface is made of rock; parts of it contains lots of impact craters, while other parts have ridges. It's the only moon known to have a substantial magnetic field. Ganymede likely has a large supply of internal water.";

"Callisto Description" =
"Callisto is a large moon with an extremely old and heavily cratered surface. It is the farthest of the Galilean moons from Jupiter. Like many other moons nearby, it may contain an ocean of water under its surface.";

"Amalthea is an inner moon of Jupiter, and it is irregularly shaped. It contains water ice and has large craters on its surface.";


// Saturn

"Saturn Description" =
"The majestic giant, Saturn, has the most dazzling display of rings in our Solar System. Its magnificent rings are composed of ice, rocks, and dust particles which likely accumulated from debris after the destruction of a former moon. The planet itself is the second largest in the Solar System, and it has a fast rotation rate.";

"Saturnian System Description" =
"Saturn has a variety of moons with very interesting properties that are worth exploring. For instance, Titan is the only world other than Earth known to contain liquid on its surface; Enceladus is known to have enormous geysers that eject material out into space; Mimas looks like a superweapon!";

"Mimas Description" =
"That's no moon – wait, it is! Mimas is a large moon of Saturn with an absolutely gargantuan impact crater, and its surface is littered with others.";

"Enceladus Description" =
"Enceladus is a large Saturnian satellite mostly covered in ice. Its surface contains geysers that eject water vapor and hydrogen into space. It has geologic activity and may contain a subsurface ocean.";

"Phobe Description" =
"Phoebe is a Saturnian moon, likely a captured object from the Kuiper Belt. It has a large irregular shape.";

"Janus Description" =
"Janus is a moon of Saturn. It occupies the same orbit as Epimetheus; they were once thought to be the same object.";

"Epimetheus Description" =
"Epimetheus is a moon of Saturn. It occupies the same orbit as Janus; they were once thought to be the same object.";

"Pandora Description" =
"Pandora is a small inner moon of Saturn. It has a very chaotic orbit and it is made of mostly ice.";

"The icy world of Neptune is a place full of incredible windstorms. The planet's atmosphere is very active and has strong weather patterns, earning the record for the highest wind speeds ever recorded in the Solar System. Neptune's existence was predicted by physics before it was actually observed for the first time.";

"Neptunian System Description" =
"The Neptunian System is interesting in that it was likely hugely disrupted by the capture of the massive moon Triton. The extreme inclination of Triton's orbit indicates it did not originate here.";

"Triton Description" =
"Triton is the largest moon of Neptune. It orbits retrograde, in the opposite direction of Neptune's rotation; it is the largest moon in the Solar System that does this. This has led to the idea that Triton was once a dwarf planet that was trapped in orbit around Neptune. Triton is mostly made of liquid nitrogen and water ice.";

"Nereid Description" =
"Nereid is a satellite of Neptune. It has the most eccentric orbit of any moon in the Solar System.";

"Naiad Description" =

"Proteus Description" =
"Proteus is the second largest moon of Neptune. It is mostly made of ice and it has an irregular shape.";


// Pluto

"Pluto Description" =
"Pluto is a large dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt. Once considered the ninth planet, it was dethroned after its vast array of dwarf planet siblings started being discovered. Pluto has a very elliptical orbit, sometimes crossing over the orbit of Neptune. It has a very large moon, Charon, which has a large gravitational influence on it.";

"Charon Description" =
"Charon is the largest Plutonian moon, and the largest moon among the dwarf planets. It is so large that it is gravitationally locked to Pluto, and the two objects seem to be in a binary system, facing each other at all times.";

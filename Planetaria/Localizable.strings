// MARK: - Objects



// MARK: Sun

"Solar System Description" =
"The Solar System is a massive conglomeration of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other objects gravitationally bound to the Sun.";

"Sun Description" =
"The Sun is a yellow main-sequence star in the center of the Solar System. It's composed of plasma and incandescent gas at unimaginably hot temperatures. The Sun produces nuclear energy by fusing hydrogen into helium in its core, and it radiates light and heat to all of the planets and moons of the Solar System.";


// MARK: Planets


// Mercury

"Mercury Description" =
"Though it may be small, Mercury is the fastest planet in the Solar System, zooming around the Sun in only three months along its wobbly, eccentric orbit. Its surface is heavily cratered, and it has no atmosphere, causing temperatures to range from really hot on the light side to really cold on the dark side.";


// Venus

"Venus Description" =
"Venus holds the title of the hottest planet in the Solar System. Its extremely hot and dense atmosphere, filled with thick clouds of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, would immediately vaporize any living organism. It also spins really slowly, in the opposite direction of most other planets.";


// Earth

"Earth Description" =
"Earth is the only known world to contain life. It's a terrestrial planet with an active and habitable surface, filled with deep oceans, lush forests, vast deserts, and high mountains. Earth's position in the Solar System allows for liquid water, which, along with an oxygen-rich atmosphere, lets living organisms thrive.";

"Earth-Moon System Description" =
"Our local system, the only place humanity has ever set foot, is composed of the Earth and the Moon. The Moon's position relative to the Sun causes a cycle of lunar phases to be visible from Earth throughout its monthly orbit. The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, meaning we always see the same side.";

"Moon Description" =
"The Moon is Earth's sole natural satellite, and it's one of the largest in the Solar System. The Moon is notable for its distinctive lunar phases as viewed from Earth, as well as its tidal effects on Earth's oceans. It's tidally locked to Earth, which means we only ever see one side.";


// Mars

"Mars Description" =
"Mars is a rocky planet with a distinctive rust color covering its barren surface. It's thought to have once contained large amounts of liquid water, but it has gradually evolved into a desolate landscape of rusting iron. Olympus Mons, a large volcano on the Martian surface, is the tallest mountain in the Solar System.";

"Martian System Description" =
"Mars hosts a pair of moons known as Phobos and Deimos. They're small objects which are barely even spherical and span only a few kilometers – they also orbit very closely to Mars. Compared to Earth's moon as well as those of the gas giants, the Martian moons are fairly unimpressive.";

"Phobos Description" =
"Phobos is the larger of the two Martian moons, and it orbits very closely to the planet's surface, with an orbital period of just a few hours. It has an oblong shape and many impact craters. In the far future, Phobos is expected to either crash into Mars or be torn apart by its gravity.";

"Deimos Description" =
"Deimos is the smaller and farther of the two moons of Mars. It is irregularly shaped and heavily cratered.";


// Jupiter

"Jupiter Description" =
"Behold! The ruler of the Solar System, Jupiter. This enormous planet – the biggest one in the Solar System – is a gas giant known for its swirling bands of colorful clouds. Its distinctive Great Red Spot is actually a huge storm that has been active for centuries. Jupiter spins very quickly, and it has a vast array of moons as companions.";

"Jovian System Description" =
"Jupiter boasts a large quantity of natural satellites, and some of the largest in the Solar System. Among them are the Galilean Moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These four massive moons were the first moons besides Earth's to be discovered, and they're planets in their own right. Even more moons continue to be discovered today.";

"Io Description" =
"The initial sight of Io may be shocking – this unique moon really does look like a giant pizza. Io is a large and extremely dense moon, and it's home to lots of geologic activity, giving its surface a strange mix of colors and varied topology. It has high mountains and lots of volcanoes.";

"Europa Description" =
"Europa is a large moon of Jupiter with a thin atmosphere and a smooth surface marked with streaks, like nails on a chalkboard. It contains a deep ocean of liquid water beneath its surface which could potentially be hospitable for some form of extraterrestrial life.";

"Ganymede Description" =
"Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, even larger than the planet Mercury. Parts of its rocky surface contains lots of impact craters, while other parts have ridges. Ganymede is the only moon known to have a substantial magnetic field. It also likely has a large supply of internal water.";

"Callisto Description" =
"Callisto is a large moon with an extremely old and heavily cratered surface. It is the farthest of the Galilean moons from Jupiter. It has an icy and rocky surface which may contain an ocean underneath.";


// Saturn

"Saturn Description" =
"The majestic giant, Saturn, has the most dazzling display of rings in our Solar System. Its magnificent rings are composed of ice, rocks, and dust particles. The planet itself is the second largest in the Solar System, and it has a fast rotation rate. Saturn also has a very large and diverse set of moons.";

"Saturnian System Description" =
"Saturn has a variety of moons with very interesting properties that are worth exploring. For instance, Titan is the only world other than Earth known to contain liquid on its surface; Enceladus is known to have enormous geysers that eject material out into space; Mimas looks like a superweapon!";

"Mimas Description" =
"That's no moon – wait, it is! Mimas is a large moon of Saturn with an absolutely gargantuan impact crater, and its surface is littered with others.";

"Enceladus Description" =
"Enceladus is a large Saturnian moon mostly covered in ice. Its surface contains cryovolcanic geysers that eject plumes of water vapor and hydrogen into space. Enceladus has a lot of geologic activity and may contain a subsurface ocean.";

"Tethys Description" =
"Tethys is a large moon of Saturn. It has a very low density, and it is primarily made of water ice.";

"Dione Description" =
"Dione is a large satellite of Saturn. It is made of mostly water ice, and likely has an internal liquid salt water ocean.";

"Rhea Description" =
"Rhea is a large Saturnian moon. It contains mostly water ice and has a homogenous interior.";

"Titan is the largest Saturnian moon, and the only known moon in the Solar System with a dense atmosphere. It's also the only place in the Solar System other than Earth to contain liquid on its surface – it is covered in liquid methane.";

"Hyperion Description" =
"Hyperion is a moon of Saturn, and one of the largest irregularly-shaped bodies in the Solar System. It's composed of mostly water ice.";

"Iapetus Description" =
"Iapetus is a large moon of Saturn with a strange two-tone coloration – one side is darker and the other is lighter. Its surface is heavily cratered, and it has a high mountain range along the equator.";


// Uranus

"Uranus Description" =
"Uranus exhibits the most unusual rotational dynamics of any planet. Its axial tilt is near 90º, which causes extreme seasonal cycles. Uranus is considered an ice giant, composed of the coldest atmosphere in the Solar System, filled with icy ammonia and methane. It's also home to a large number of moons.";

"Uranian System Description" =
"Uranus contains a large set of moons, with five notable standouts – Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, and Miranda. Interestingly, the majority of the Uranian satellites are named after characters created by William Shakespeare.";

"Ariel Description" =

"Proteus Description" =
"Proteus is the second largest moon of Neptune. It is mostly made of ice and it has an irregular shape.";


// MARK: Others

"Pluto Description" =
"Pluto is a large dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt. Once considered the ninth planet, it was dethroned after its vast array of dwarf planet siblings started being discovered. Pluto has a very elliptical orbit, sometimes crossing over the orbit of Neptune. It has a very large moon, Charon, which has a large gravitational influence on it.";

"Charon Description" =
"Charon is the largest Plutonian moon, and the largest moon among the dwarf planets. It is so large that it is gravitationally locked to Pluto, and the two objects seem to be in a binary system, facing each other at all times.";

"Eris Description" =

"Sun" =
"The Sun is a middle-sized yellow star that radiates light and heat to all of the planets and moons of the Solar System. Within the Sun's unimaginably hot photosphere, there are many cooler, darker areas called sunspots. The solar wind, a stream of charged particles, is constantly emitted from the surface, along with the occasional solar flare: a more intense burst of energy.";

"Mercury" =
"Mercury is the smallest and fastest planet in the Solar System, zooming around the Sun in only three months along its eccentric orbit. Its surface is heavily cratered, and it has no atmosphere, causing temperatures to range from very hot on the light side to very cold on the dark side. Despite its high orbital speed, Mercury rotates relatively slowly.";

"Venus" =
"Venus, the hottest planet in the Solar System, is plagued by a runaway greenhouse effect. Thick clouds of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere render the planet a complete hellscape. Venus spins in the opposite direction of most planets, and it does so very slowly – one rotation actually takes longer than one orbit around the Sun.";

"Earth" =
"Earth is the only known world to contain life. It's a terrestrial planet with an active and habitable surface, filled with deep oceans, lush forests, vast deserts, and high mountains. Earth's position in the Solar System allows for an abundance of liquid water, which, along with an oxygen-rich atmosphere, lets living organisms thrive both on the land and in the water.";

"Mars" =
"Mars is known as the Red Planet due to its desolate landscapes of rusting iron. Though possibly habitable at one time in its history, the planet has gradually evolved into a barren wasteland, prone to very large and very strong dust storms. Olympus Mons, a large volcano on the Martian surface, is the tallest mountain in the Solar System.";

"Jupiter" =
"Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System, is a gas giant known for its swirling bands of colorful clouds. Its distinctive Great Red Spot is actually a huge storm that has been active for centuries. Jupiter's massive gravitational influence plays a crucial role in deflecting asteroids and comets from the inner Solar System. The planet spins quickly and has a vast array of moons.";

"Saturn" =
"Saturn is a gas giant known for its iconic system of rings, composed of many individual ice, rock, and dust particles. The second largest planet in the Solar System, Saturn has a fast rotation rate and a very low density – it would actually float if submerged in water. Saturn also boasts a very large and diverse set of moons.";

"Uranus" =
"Uranus is an ice giant in the outer Solar System. It rotates on its side, creating extreme decades-long seasonal variations. The planet's atmosphere is the coldest in the Solar System, and it contains a small amount of methane, which gives it a blue-green hue. Uranus also features a faint ring system and many moons.";

"Neptune" =
"The icy world of Neptune is a place full of incredible storms, along with the highest wind speeds ever recorded in the Solar System. Within Neptune's deep blue atmosphere lies the mysterious Great Dark Spot, a colossal storm system. Neptune also has a thin set of rings and a number of moons.";

"Pluto" =
"Pluto is a large dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt. Once thought to be a planet in its own right, it was dethroned after other similar objects started to be discovered. Pluto has an elliptical orbit, sometimes crossing over the orbit of Neptune. The surface of Pluto is diverse, featuring vast plains and icy mountains.";

"Ceres" =
"Ceres is the largest asteroid in the Solar System, orbiting between Mars and Jupiter in the Asteroid Belt. It's considered a dwarf planet – the only one in the inner Solar System. The surface of Ceres is heavily cratered, and its shape is not quite spherical. Ceres also rotates relatively quickly.";

"Eris" =
"Eris is a large dwarf planet that orbits very far away. This icy world lives in the far reaches of the Kuiper Belt and the scattered disk. Eris is noteworthy for its highly elliptical orbit, bringing it closer to the Sun at times and then taking it much farther away. It also has one known moon.";

"Haumea" =
"Haumea is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, known for its rapid rotation that gives it an elongated, egg-like shape. It has a sharply inclined orbit, two small moons, and is the only dwarf planet with a confirmed ring system.";

"Makemake" =
"Makemake is a large dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt with a high orbital inclination. Its icy surface is very reflective, making it relatively bright and red in color. Makemake also has one small moon.";

"Moon" =
"The Moon, also known as Luna, is a large satellite of Earth. It's notable for its lunar phases as viewed from Earth, as well as its tidal effects on the planet's oceans. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means only one side is ever visible. It is believed to have formed long ago after a large object known as Theia collided with Earth.";

"Phobos" =
"Phobos is the larger of the two Martian moons, and it orbits very closely to the planet's surface, with an orbital period of just a few hours. It has an oblong shape and many impact craters. In the far future, Phobos is expected to either crash into Mars or be torn apart by its gravity.";

"Deimos" =
"Deimos is the smaller and farther of the two moons of Mars. It is irregularly shaped, cratered, and has very low gravity.";

"Io" =
"Io is the innermost major moon of Jupiter. Its surface is incredibly diverse, with various geological features and extreme volcanic activity due to tidal heating. The moon is covered in sulfur compounds, giving it strange hues of red, orange, and yellow. Io is very dense, and its surface and atmosphere are constantly changing.";

"Europa" =
"Europa is a large moon of Jupiter with a thin atmosphere and a smooth surface made of water ice, marked with streaks, cracks, and ridges. It contains a deep ocean of water beneath its surface that remains liquid due to tidal heating. This subsurface ocean is a strong candidate for a potential habitat for life.";

"Ganymede" =
"Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System – it's even larger than the planet Mercury. Parts of its rocky surface contain lots of impact craters, while other parts have ridges. Ganymede is the only moon known to have a substantial magnetic field. A large supply of internal water likely exists underneath its surface.";

"Callisto" =
"Callisto is the outermost of Jupiter's major moons. It has a very old and heavily cratered surface, primarily composed of water ice and rock, and it exhibits variations in brightness between different regions. One notable site is the Valhalla crater, the largest multi-ring impact basin in the Solar System.";

"Mimas" =
"That's no moon! (But actually it is!) Mimas is a small moon located within Saturn's faint outer rings. It stands out for its extremely large impact crater, the Herschel Crater, though it likely does not house any planet-destroying lasers. Mimas's heavily cratered surface is instead composed of water ice.";

"Enceladus" =
"Enceladus is a smaller moon of Saturn. It is predominantly coated in ice, making it very reflective. Cryovolcanic geysers on the surface of Enceladus eject large plumes of water vapor and hydrogen into space. These geysers are found near the moon's south pole, marked by blue streaks, which may connect the geysers to a subsurface ocean of water.";

"Tethys" =
"Tethys is a large moon of Saturn that has a very low density and is primarily composed of water ice. Its surface is very reflective and contains various geological formations. Notable features include Odysseus, a crater that covers a large portion of the surface, and Ithaca Chasma, a large canyon-like rift that encircles much of Tethys.";

"Dione" =
"Dione is a large moon of Saturn. Composed of water ice and silicate rock, this moon may harbor an internal liquid saltwater ocean. Dione's surface is home to a network of bright ice cliffs, along with large streaks, and varying amounts of craters.";

"Rhea" =
"Rhea is the second-largest Saturnian moon. It is composed of water ice and rock, which causes it to be very bright. Rhea's surface is heavily cratered and contains a few large fractures. It may also have its own ring system, which would make it the only known moon with rings.";

"Titan" =
"Titan is the largest Saturnian moon, and the only known moon in the Solar System with a dense atmosphere, mainly composed of nitrogen and methane. Its thick, hazy atmosphere has a yellow hue due to the combination of gases. Lakes and seas of liquid methane cover the surface of Titan, making it the only world other than Earth known to contain liquid on its surface.";

"Iapetus" =
"Iapetus is the farthest of Saturn's major moons. Its surface is marked with a strange two-tone coloration – one side is darker and the other is lighter, both in color and in brightness. The equatorial ridge, a mountain range that runs along Iapetus's equator, is the tallest geological formation on any known moon.";

"Ariel" =
"Arel is a moon of Uranus whose surface displays a mix of young, smooth plains and older, more cratered regions. It is the most reflective Uranian moon, composed of water ice.";

"Umbriel" =
"Umbriel is a large moon of Uranus. It is characterized by its dark, heavily cratered surface, and it stands out as one of the darkest moons in the solar system.";
 
"Titania" =
"Titania is the largest moon of Uranus. Known for its diverse terrain – which consists of impact craters, valleys, and fault lines – Titania is thought to have a relatively young surface compared to other moons.";

"Oberon" =
"Oberon is the second-largest moon of Uranus. Its surface has been bombarded with many impact craters, and it also features deep valleys and canyons. A subsurface ocean may exist beneath Oberon's icy shell.";

"Miranda" =
"Miranda is the smallest and innermost major Uranian moon. It has a chaotic surface with varied terrain, featuring large faults, fractures, and ridges.";

"Triton" =
"Triton is the largest moon of Neptune. It orbits retrograde, in the opposite direction of Neptune's rotation – it's the largest retrograde moon in the Solar System. Triton has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen with trace amounts of methane. Its surface contains icy volcanoes and geysers that spew nitrogen gas into space.";

"Charon" =
"Charon is the largest Plutonian moon, and the largest moon among the dwarf planets. It is so large that it is gravitationally locked to Pluto, and the two objects seem to be in a binary system, facing each other at all times. Charon's surface contains mountains, craters, and mysterious dark spots.";
